Just playing around with Sanity, so far Ilke it!. Here i made a little blog with react. For the styling I play with tailwind CSS and use CROQ to query data from thev CMS to the page.

### Core Technologies

Create a more ambitious project, maybe my portafolio. I've been looking for a way to simplify the maintenance of my portafolio and i think this could be a good solution.
